## Description
This weather dashboard was a project to test what we have learned on server side APIs. I went with the Open Weather API. I wanted to keep a modern look with this webpage and create something that people can use daily. Open Weather API offers abundent documentaion and numerous other APIs that may come in handy for feature upgrades.


## Installation
